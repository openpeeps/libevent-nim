## About
Libevent is an event notification library with a focus on asynchronous IO. It provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. It also supports callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts.

Libevent additionally provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network IO, with support for sockets, filters, rate-limiting, SSL, zero-copy file transmission, and IOCP. Libevent includes support for several useful protocols, including DNS, HTTP, and a minimal RPC framework.
